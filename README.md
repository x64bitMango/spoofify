### A static, locally hostable, decentralized music playing & storing web application in the style of Spotify.
**No live servers/databases required. Built solely through caching and localStorage in JavaScript with the purpose of being hostable by anyone with at least a smidge of web literacy. Just fork and spin up a GitHub Page. No backend, no nonsense.**

Right now, Spoofify’s in what I’ll generously call super-beta-alpha-pre-release-mode™.
The HTML skeleton’s up and walking, the CSS is doing its best runway impression, but the JS brain hasn’t been installed yet, meaning no actual playback or logic is wired up. The main page layout is there, all the song tiles are struttin’ around looking pretty, but the buttons are purely decorative for now.

So yeah, it’s more of a vibe than an app right now.

> ## THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT CORRELATED TO THE SPOOFIFY COIN IN ANY WAY NOR DO WE HAVE ANY PLANS ON DOING ANYTHING WITH CRYPTO

## The Web App
### TODO (aka The “Things That Will Someday Work” list)
**Music-related**:
- [ ] 🎵 Add JavaScript audio logic – make the play button actually play, pause actually pause, and have only one track playing at a time
- [ ] 🔁 Add looping + shuffle options
- [ ] 📊 Implement a working progress bar – update in real time with the song’s playback, not your hopes and dreams
- [ ] 💾 Set up caching & localStorage – store song data, playback state, and maybe even user preferences (locally)

**Extra**:
- [ ] 🧭 Create other pages – a “Now Playing” screen, maybe a Library view, and a barebones Playlist page to start
- [ ] 🎨 Add subtle transitions & hover effects maybe
- [ ] 🐞 Cry over inevitable bugs, fix them, then cry again when they come back

### Credits and Honorable Mentions

**Big** thank you to [Omerko's YouTube video on building a spotify-like skeleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZqEmRQjLM) and his open [source code](https://codepen.io/omerko96/pen/wvXgQZK).

Little thank you to [AlarmedCheese85](https://github.com/AlarmedCheese85) who came up with the idea in the boring morning of school during our second bell, and [RightOnAether](https://github.com/RightOnAether), as the moral support(!!) while I carry this project on my back for us.
